## Ground Rules

* Only include high-quality, actively maintained tools.  
* One PR per logical change.

---

## Before You Start

1. **Search first.** Make sure your tool or change is not already listed or proposed.  
2. **Check activity.** Projects abandoned for >12 months with no commits or releases will be rejected unless they are still widely used.  
3. **Fork** the repository and create a new branch.

---

## Adding Updating or Removing a Tool

* **Add** choose the single best existing category. If none fits, see [Adding a New Category](#adding-a-new-category). 
* **Update** descriptions only to fix factual errors or clarify scope—avoid hype.  
* **Remove** dead links or unmaintained projects (≥ 24 months inactivity) through a PR titled `Remove: <ToolName>` with evidence (e.g., commit log, archived notice).

---

## Adding a New Category

1. Confirm no existing category reasonably fits your tools.  
2. Propose the category in an issue first; wait for maintainer approval.  
3. Keep category names short, application-focused, and non-overlapping.

---

## Style Guide

* **Commit messages:** `<Add/Update/Remove>: <ToolName>`.
